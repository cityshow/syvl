**What Is Syvl?**

Syvl is an open source discord message logger. It uses the discord API to do so.



**How do I install it?**

Git clone the repository by using `git clone https://github.com/cityshow/syvl.git`, and install the requirements.txt file.



**why is it giving me "event loop is closed"?**

You may have either entered an invalid token, or didn't edit the file 'config.py'. All you have to do is replace the message in between the quotes with a valid token, and then run the program.



**What can it do?**

Syvl has an option to aswell log edited messages, which can be turned on and off by using the command line arguments. (`python3 syvl.py True/False`)
